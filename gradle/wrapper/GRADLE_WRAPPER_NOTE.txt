GRADLE WRAPPER JAR

The gradle-wrapper.jar file is a binary file that will be automatically 
generated by Android Studio when you first open and sync this project.

This file is required for Gradle builds but is safe to be generated automatically.

When you open this project in Android Studio:
1. Android Studio will detect the missing wrapper jar
2. It will automatically download and install the correct version
3. The project will sync successfully

No manual action is required from you!

If you want to manually generate it, run this command in the project root:
gradle wrapper

The wrapper ensures that everyone uses the same Gradle version for building.
