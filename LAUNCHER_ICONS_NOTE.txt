LAUNCHER ICONS

The launcher icons (app icons) will be automatically generated by Android Studio when you first open the project.

If you want to customize your app icon:

1. Right-click on 'res' folder in Android Studio
2. Select New > Image Asset
3. Choose your icon image
4. Click Next > Finish

Android Studio will automatically generate all required icon sizes and densities:
- mipmap-mdpi
- mipmap-hdpi
- mipmap-xhdpi
- mipmap-xxhdpi
- mipmap-xxxhdpi

Default icons will be used until you customize them.
